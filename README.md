Elephas
=======
Elephas is a managed toolkit to provide pre-commit project build & unit-testing. The Elephas project is published under the [MIT License](https://github.com/rschiang/elephas/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

### Status
* A scripting engine has been proposed, influenced by Python syntax with basic features.
* Due to the availability of `Microsoft.Build.dll`, the Elephas project targets .NET 4.0 (full profile). You can, however, compile with lower versions of .NET Framework with preprocessor directive `NO_MSBUILD` enabled. We hope to modularize MSBuild parts to eliminate this kind of dependency.
* Specifications of Elephas Script will be updated shortly.
